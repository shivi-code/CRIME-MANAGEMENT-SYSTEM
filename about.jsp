        <h6>  <p align = "left" style="color:white">Crime is a part of illegal activities in 
                human life. It is quite obvious that the rate of crimes is <br>increasing day by day in all
                societies across the world, but we do believe that there is a lot <br> which can be done by both 
                the governments and the individuals to reduce the crimes in com-<br>-munities. The rise of 
                population and complex society rises the range of anti-social conducts <br> that must be restricted
                by the government through the military and different organizations <br> particularly the Police 
                Force. There are many current crime management systems which faces <br> several difficulties, 
                as there is no means to report crime instantly other than phone calls,<br> messaging or 
                face-to-face complian  filing. Hence,this online crime management system allows <br> the user to
                file complaints, register criminal record and keep a track of it by using database. <br>
                There are 2 categories that a user can do, Complaint register, criminal Register and 
                can see<br> all the status of what action has been taken by the admin. To file any of the above 2 
                complaints,<br> the user should register in to the systemand provide his right credentials to file them.
                The<br> Front End of the crime management system is done using jsp and My-SQL serves as a back-<br>-end to store data 
                . The system, has both the user as well the Admin Part, the role of admin is <br> to register complaints , see 
                criminal records and keeping track of what is going in the system.<br>This system helps the users in tracking any
                report filed to the law and take an advantage of <br> reporting any complaint from anywhere 
                bringing the whole system online.</p></h6>
